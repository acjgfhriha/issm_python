	MESHPROFILEINTERSECTION - Takes a .exp file (made of several profiles), and figures out its intersection with a mesh

		input:
			  index,x,y is a triangulation
			  filename: name of Argus style .exp file containing the segments (can be groups of disconnected segments)

		output:
			  segments: array made of x1,y1,x2,y2,element_id lines (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) are segment extremities for a segment 
			  belonging to the elemnt_id element. there are as many lines in segments as there are segments intersecting the 
			  mesh.
