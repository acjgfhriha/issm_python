def robintemperature(heatflux,accumrate,thickness,surftemp,z):
	'''
	Compute vertical temperature profile of an ice sheet (Robin, 1955)

	This routine computes the vertical temperature profile of an ice sheet
	according to the solution of Robin (1955), neglecting friction and
	horizontal advection.  The solution is thus most appropriate at an ice
	divide.

	The coordinate system for the solution runs from z=0 at the base 
	to z=H at the surface of the ice.

	Parameters (SI units):
		-heatflux	Geothermal heat flux (W m^-2)
		-accumrate	Surface accumulation rate (m s^-1 ice equivalent)
		-thickness	Ice thickness (m)
		-surftemp	Surface temperature (K)
		-z				Vertical position at which to calculate temperature
						(z can be a scalar or a vector)

	Returns a vector the same length as z containing the temperature in K

	Usage:
		tprofile=robintemperature(heatflux,accumrate,thickness,surftemp,z)
